Steps to Run the Code

Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

Prepare your dataset:

Create two folders inside your project directory:

cats/    # place cat images here
dogs/    # place dog images here


Ensure images are in .jpg or .png format.

Install dependencies (see below for full list).

Run the classification script:

python classify_cats_dogs.py


The output will display the predicted class (cat or dog) and the confidence for each image.

Optionally, the program saves a report or highlights misclassified images for further analysis.

Dependencies Required

Make sure Python 3.10+ is installed. Install the required packages using pip:

pip install torch torchvision matplotlib numpy opencv-python pillow


torch: For loading the pre-trained neural network.

torchvision: For model architectures and image transforms.

matplotlib: Optional, for displaying images and results.

numpy: For numerical operations on image data.

opencv-python: Optional, for advanced image handling.

Pillow: For opening and processing images.

Assumptions Made

Images are clear, and each image contains a single object (either a cat or a dog).

The model uses an ImageNet pre-trained network for classification.

Input image size will be resized according to the model requirements (usually 224x224 for most ImageNet models).

The script assumes that the cats/ and dogs/ folders exist and contain images.

Python environment is correctly set up with all dependencies installed.
